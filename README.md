# Project + Community Matchup Data ETL
ETL Pipeline for P+ Matchup Data

Pipeline for processing responses collected from a Google Form survey into data formatted for statistical analysis.

Utilizes Python, Pandas, and NumPy for data processing, and Jupyter for [documenting the workflow](https://github.com/joeWatersDev/pplus-etl/blob/main/PPlusETL.ipynb).

## Purpose
Intended data usage is to create:
- A matchup chart
- A confidence rating for each matchup
- Tier lists based on multiple statistical factors

Final formatted results can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E2tkjYEXMPvdOjlCBqv1U7iHilljt_u1QNM7mPG3NXg/edit?usp=sharing "P+ 2023 Community Matchup Chart").
